# “OcuTrack”: Personal Eye Tracking Profile (Eye Tracking)
- Plan and estimate development tasks and work to improve performance metrics
- Work closely with other engineers to develop the best technical design and approach for new product development
• Take complete ownership of his or her development work
• Design, develop, troubleshoot, and debug mission critical software source code using modern software development languages and tools, such as Python or Java
• Demonstrates working knowledge of OcuTrack Development
• Participate in the full software development lifecycle, working within broadly defined parameters
• Provide development estimates
• Collaborate with a team of three to design and develop computer vision system for tracking athlete eye movement to
detect and diagnose abnormalities that may indicate concussion or mild Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)
• Developed Python OpenCV software for Raspberry Pi to capture video and modulate video frame to localize the face
and detect eye location while minimizing Iris region with circle detection
• Understand of Quality System Regulation (QSR), Class I and II medical device, and Good Manufacturing Practice
(GMP)
• Experience with FEA simulation on different material use in prototype and perform design of experiments (DOEs)
• Assist each team members with all phrase of project from designing, prototyping, testing, troubleshooting, and
documenting design process and 21 CFR 820 design control of medical device toward 510(k) submissions
• Created and maintained Google Docs for Design History File (DHF), Device History Record (DHR), Device Master Record (DMR), and Quality System Record (QSR)
• Experience in product development in all phase of develop Python code to capture video frame real-time and localize each eye location to identify iris of the end users.
