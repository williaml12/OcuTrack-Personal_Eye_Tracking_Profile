# “OcuTrack”: Personal Eye Tracking Profile (Eye Tracking)
- Plan and estimate development tasks and work to improve performance metrics
Work closely with other engineers to develop the best technical design and approach for new product development
Take complete ownership of his or her development work
Design, develop, troubleshoot, and debug mission-critical software source code using modern software development languages and tools, such as Python or Java
Demonstrates working knowledge of OcuTrack Development
Participate in the entire software development lifecycle, working within broadly defined parameters
Provide development estimates
Collaborate with a team of three people to design and develop a computer vision system for tracking athlete eye movement to
detect and diagnose abnormalities that may indicate concussion or mild Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)
 Developed Python OpenCV software for Raspberry Pi to capture video and modulate video frames to localize the face
and detect eye location while minimizing the Iris region with circle detection
